    "## Installing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, make sure you're in a Python virtual environment first, have a Nvidia GPU, and have the CUDA toolkit installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to installing `llama-cpp-python`, we'll need to do some extra steps. All you'll need to do is set some additional CLI environment variables before executing the pip command to install libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands to set the environment variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `$env:CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DGGML_CUDA=on\"`\n",
    "- `$env:FORCE_CMAKE=1`\n",
    "- `$env:CUDACXX=\"C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v<version_number>\\bin\\nvcc.exe\"`\n",
    "  - Change `<version_number>` to whichever version of the CUDA toolkit you have installed.\n",
    "  - For instructions on downloading and installing the CUDA toolkit on Windows, visit [this link](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note for Linux Users\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands to set the environment variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `export CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DGGML_CUDA=on\"`\n",
    "- `export FORCE_CMAKE=1`\n",
    "- `export CUDACXX=\"<path_to_nvcc_executable>\"`\n",
    "  - Where `<path_to_nvcc_executable>` is your installation path to the executable for your Linux distribution's CUDA Toolkit installation.\n",
    "  - For instructions on downloading and installing the CUDA toolkit on Windows, visit [this link](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).\n",

    "## HuggingFace Hub Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to create a HuggingFace account and access token:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an account on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co).\n",
    "2. Once logged into your account, click your profile picture in the upper right corner and navigate to Settings > Access Tokens.\n",
    "3. Click New Token and generate a new token, I made mine a \"Write\" token but it shouldn't matter if it's a \"Read\" or \"Write\" token for this script.\n",
    "4. Run the command `huggingface-cli login` and paste in the access token you created in step 3.\n",

    "## Git & Git LFS Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't already have it installed.\n",
    "   1. Setup your git account and verify that you're able to clone a private repo (doesn't matter if the repo actually has anything in it, just need to make sure that you're able to use git properly).\n",
    "   2. Follow the git-lfs install guide [git-lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=installation_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs#installing).\n",
    "   3. If you didn't run it in the guide, run the command `git lfs install` after getting git setup and git-lfs installed.\n",
