# Most importantly, make sure you're in a Python virtual environment first, have
# an Nvidia GPU, and have the CUDA toolkit installed.

# Prior to installing `llama-cpp-python`, we'll need to do some extra steps. All
# you'll need to do is set some additional CLI environment variables before 
# executing the pip command to install libraries.


# Windows

# The commands to set the environment variables are:

# - `$env:CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on"`
# - `$env:FORCE_CMAKE=1`
# - `$env:CUDACXX="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v<version_number>\bin\nvcc.exe"`
#   - Change `<version_number>` to whichever version of the CUDA toolkit you have installed.
#   - For instructions on downloading and installing the CUDA toolkit on 
#     Windows, visit
#     https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html.

# Linux

# The commands to set the environment variables are:

# - `export CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on"`
# - `export FORCE_CMAKE=1`
# - `export CUDACXX="<path_to_nvcc_executable>"`
#   - Where `<path_to_nvcc_executable>` is your installation path to the 
#     executable for your Linux distribution's CUDA Toolkit installation.
#   - For instructions on downloading and installing the CUDA toolkit on 
#     Windows, visit
#     https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html.

# Once the environment variables have been set, execute the following pip 
# command to download and install the appropriately compiled `llama-cpp-python`
# and other necessary packages.

# pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir llama-cpp-python jupyter huggingface_hub

# HuggingFace Hub Setup

# You'll need to create a HuggingFace account and access token:

# 1. Create an account on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co).
# 2. Once logged into your account, click your profile picture in the upper 
#    right corner and navigate to Settings > Access Tokens.
# 3. Click New Token and generate a new token, I made mine a "Write" token but 
#    it shouldn't matter if it's a "Read" or "Write" token for this script.
# 4. Run the command `huggingface-cli login` and paste in the access token you 
#    created in step 3.

# Git & Git LFS Setup

# 1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't already have it 
#    installed.
#    1. Set up your git account and verify that you're able to clone a private
#       repo (doesn't matter if the repo actually has anything in it, just need 
#       to make sure that you're able to use git properly).
#    2. Follow the git-lfs install guide 
#       https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=installation_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs#installing.
#    3. If you didn't run it in the guide, run the command `git lfs install` 
#       after getting git setup and git-lfs installed.
